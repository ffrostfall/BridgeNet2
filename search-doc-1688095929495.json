This means you need to pass a table into Bridge:Fire if you want to send multiple arguments, instead of separate arguments. This design choice was chosen because it removes a layer of complexity, alongside being better for performance, stability, and typechecking. Doing this also means BridgeNet2 never needs to manipulate the data that's pushed, the library can just directly send that data through the RemoteEvent. "},{"title":"Why is BridgeNet2 opinionated?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Intro","url":"/BridgeNet2/docs/intro#why-is-bridgenet2-opinionated","content":"This library favors performance, and therefore we made choices that resulted in an opinionated library.

The key is the compressed identifier, the value is the string value. The list is stored as attributes under the BridgeNet2 RemoteEvent. Identifiers are actually just numbers compressed using string.pack- every time you create an identifier, it increments that number by one and creates the attribute. /src/Server/ServerIdentifiers.luau -- optimization for under 255 identifiers local packed = if identifierCount &lt;= 255 then string.pack(&quot;B&quot;, identifierCount) else string.pack(&quot;H&quot;, identifierCount) identifierCount += 1 identifierStorage:SetAttribute(identifierName, packed) fullIdentifierMap[identifierName] = packed compressedIdentifierMap[packed] = identifierName On the client, the client listens for new attributes added and attribute changes. It then stores these identifiers locally- the Serialize and Deserialize functions just directly interface with that table. This is why the ReferenceIdentifier function yields- it basically just waits a bit to see if the attribute loads in. If it already exists, it just accesses that in the local table. /src/Client/ClientIdentifiers.luau for id, value in identifierStorage:GetAttributes() do fullIdentifierMap[id] = value compressedIdentifierMap[value] = id end ","keywords":""},{"title":"Logging network traffic","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/BridgeNet2/docs/Tutorials/Logging","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Log dumps​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Logging network traffic","url":"/BridgeNet2/docs/Tutorials/Logging#log-dumps","content":"As of right now, log dumps are not a supported feature unfortunately.

The API is, as said in previous sections, extremely simple and similar to RemoteEvents. The first difference between RemoteEvents and bridges is that bridges are created from strings, and RemoteEvents are instances. You can use the ReferenceBridge function under BridgeNet2 to create a bridge like so: local myFirstBridge = BridgeNet2.ReferenceBridge(&quot;myFirstBridge&quot;)  info The variable name and the bridge's name don't need to match (as shown later), but it is a recommended practice when using BridgeNet2. It's very important to note that the strings must be the exact same on both the client and the server. But don't worry; BridgeNet2 will warn and tell you something's wrong if it can't find a bridge on the client!

ReferenceBridge is used the exact same way on the server and the client. This is because there's no real reason to make them different, apart from typechecking. If you are interested in more &quot;correct&quot; typechecking/autocomplete, you can use the ServerBridge and ClientBridge functions like so: -- On the client.. local myFirstBridgeClientVersion = BridgeNet2.ClientBridge(&quot;myFirstBridge&quot;) -- On the server.. local myFirstBridgeServerVersion = BridgeNet2.ServerBridge(&quot;myFirstBridge&quot;)  caution ClientBridge yields, and so does using ReferenceBridge on the client!
