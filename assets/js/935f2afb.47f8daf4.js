This is because BridgeNet2\'s optimization process is relatively complex, and bridges need to have a simplistic API for the internal process.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"Technical Details/Identifiers":{"id":"Technical Details/Identifiers","title":"Identifiers","description":"Identifiers are actually extremely simple: it\'s a shared key-value list. The key is the compressed identifier, the value is the string value. The list is stored as attributes under the BridgeNet2 RemoteEvent.
