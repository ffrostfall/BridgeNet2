# About

BridgeNet2 is an advanced networking library for Roblox that offers a range of features for **optimizing, securing, and debugging network communication**. Key benefits of using BridgeNet2 include its **speed** and how it's faster than built-in Roblox networking functions and uses less bandwidth; A load of utility features such as **middleware, rate limiting, hexadecimal functions, and optimization functions**; and its **strict typing**, which allows for type checking of both incoming and outgoing data. BridgeNet2 also includes security features such as the ability to **control network security** and the contents of messages, and it can **disrupt the output of RemoteSpy logs**, making it harder for exploiters to read them.

# Why should you use BridgeNet2?

- Performance: faster than roblox, less bandwidth used than Roblox.
- Utility features: Middleware, rate limiting, hexadecimal functions, optimization functions, and more.
- Fully strictly typed: this lets you typecheck what you're sending in, and typecheck what you're sending out.
- Botches RemoteSpy logs: Since BridgeNet2 sends a special format, it botches RemoteSpy logs and makes the output less readable for exploiters.
- Security: BridgeNet2 lets you have control over network security, and what the contents of your messages are.
- Debugging: Tons of useful features for debugging your netcode.
- Natively written for Luau: There's no leftover features, or half-baked features meant for typescript.
- **No other networking library offers all of these things.**

# Why should you use BridgeNet2 over BridgeNet?

BridgeNet2 is far more advanced and resourceful than BridgeNet and other competing libraries.

- BridgeNet2 is more **efficient**, with a smaller size in the 200-remotes-a-frame stress test and faster API call times. This makes the library 75% better than Roblox in terms of performance.

- BridgeNet2's API is **enhanced**, with better naming, functionality, typings, and runtime typechecking.

- BridgeNet2 is **strictly typed** in Luau and includes better utility functions such as ToReadableHex, NumberToBestForm, and more.

- BridgeNet2 is **simpler and easier** to maintain, while still offering improved security features like rate-limiting, better runtime typechecking, and better format checking.
